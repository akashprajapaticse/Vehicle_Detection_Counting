# Vehicle Detection and Counting

This project uses **YOLOv8** for real-time **vehicle detection and counting** within a custom-defined rhombus Region of Interest (ROI) on a video feed. The detection results are displayed through a user-friendly **Tkinter GUI**.

## 📽 Demo
The system processes the uploaded video (`uploads/test_file.mp4`) and displays the number of detected vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks) inside the rhombus area.

## 🧠 Model
- Model: [`yolov8n.pt`](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Framework: [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/)
- Detected Classes: Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck (Class IDs: 2, 3, 5, 7)

## 📦 Requirements

## 🔷 Region of Interest (ROI)

Vehicles are only counted if their center point lies **inside a rhombus-shaped ROI**, defined as:
```python
rhombus_roi = np.array([[80, 400], [240, 100], [400, 100], [550, 400]], np.int32)
```

## 🧑‍💻 How to Run

```bash
python detect.py
```

- The GUI will launch and start processing the video.
- Click **"Stop Detection"** to quit the GUI safely.

## ❓ Features

- ✅ Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
- ✅ Tkinter-based interactive GUI
